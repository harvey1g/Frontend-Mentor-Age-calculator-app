## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Java Script
- Media queries


### What I learned

This challenged my Java Script skills, and as I am new to JavaScript, it helped me understand some of the fundamentals. When I got stuck, I used research and chat GPT to get support, as well as asking for explanations from chat GPT. Although I became frustrated when making this design responsive I managed it in the end, the more I work on building responsive designs, the better I will get.


### Continued development

I want to improve my website's responsiveness because I'm currently battling with it and feel like I'm putting together workarounds. I'm also excited to better at Java script because I see so many benefits to using it.
